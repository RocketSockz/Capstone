# JSON Schema
A package for centralized handling of OpsCompass JSON Schema.

## What it does
This package builds on top of an existing JSON Schema validator (AJV), and further implements custom JSON Schema elements on top of them. AJV at a base level handles a lot of what OpsCompass needs, however a couple other dependencies make this package powerful. 

### What we use 
#### ajv
As mentioned above, AJV (Another JSON Validator) is a json schema library that allows for validating JSON objects. This document will not go in depth about what JSON schema is or how to author them, however you can read more information about the validator from the links below.
#### ajv-keywords
A package that adds additional JSON schema keywords outside of the community defined ones. These are introduced directly by the AJV developers and community. 

#### ajv-formats
A package that adds additional format checking into JSON Schema. In the base version of JSON Schema you are able to define what format or type an object shall be, an array, an object, etc. This package increases that functionality, allowing to check for email formatting and other things. 

#### ajv-errors 
A package that allows for more robust error handling and messages in JSON schema.
