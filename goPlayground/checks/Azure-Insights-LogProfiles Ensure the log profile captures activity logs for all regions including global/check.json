  "rationale": "A log profile controls how the activity Log is exported. Ensuring that logs are exported from all the Azure supported regions/locations means that logs for potentially unexpected activities occurring in otherwise unused regions are stored and made available for incident response and investigations. Including global region/location in the log profile locations ensures all events from the control/management plane will be exported, as many events in the activity log are global events.",
