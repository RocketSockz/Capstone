Similarly, GCP won't deliver a packet whose destination IP address is different than the IP address of the instance receiving the packet. However, both capabilities are required if you want to useinstances to help route packets. To enable this source and destination IP check, disable the canIpForwardfield, which allows an instance to send and receive packets with non-matching destination or source IPs.",
