  "rationale": "By Enabling you will have container and system logs, Kubernetes Engine deploys a per-node logging agent that reads container logs, adds helpful metadata, and then stores them. The logging agent checks for container logs in the following sources:\nStandard output and standard error logs from containerized processes\nkubelet and container runtime logs\nLogs for system components, such as VM startup scripts\nFor events, Kubernetes Engine uses a Deployment in the kube-system namespace which automatically collects events and sends them to Stackdriver Logging. Stackdriver Logging is compatible with JSON and glog formats. Logs are stored for up to 30 days.",
