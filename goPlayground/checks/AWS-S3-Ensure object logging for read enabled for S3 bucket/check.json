    "resourceType": "AWS::CloudTrail::Trail",
    "severity": "high",
    "description": "S3 object-level API operations such as GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject are called data events. By default, CloudTrail trails don't log data events and so it is recommended to enable Object-level logging for S3 buckets.",
    "rationale": "Enabling object-level logging will help you meet data compliance requirements within your organization, perform comprehensive security analysis, monitor specific patterns of user behavior in your AWS account or take immediate actions on any object-level API activity within your S3 Buckets using Amazon CloudWatch Events.",

    "recommended_action": "**From Console:**\r\n\r\n1. Login to the AWS Management Console and navigate to S3 dashboard at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/`\r\n2. In the left navigation panel, click `buckets` and then click on the S3 Bucket Name that you want to examine.\r\n3. Click `Properties` tab to see in detail bucket configuration.\r\n4. If the current status for `Object-level` logging is set to Disabled, then object-level logging of write events for the selected s3 bucket is not set.\r\n5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 to verify object level logging status of other S3 buckets.\r\n\r\n**From Command Line:**\r\n\r\n1. Run `list-trails` command to list the names of all Amazon CloudTrail trails currently available in the selected AWS region:\r\n```\r\naws cloudtrail list-trails --region <region-name> --query Trails[*].Name\r\n```\r\n2. The command output will be a list of the requested trail names.\r\n3. Run `get-event-selectors` command using the name of the trail returned at the previous step and custom query filters to determine if Data events logging feature is enabled within the selected CloudTrail trail configuration for s3bucket resources:\r\n```\r\naws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --region <region-name> --trail-name <trail-name> --query EventSelectors[*].DataResources[]\r\n```\r\n4. The command output should be an array that contains the configuration of the AWS resource(S3 bucket) defined for the Data events selector.\r\n5. If the `get-event-selectors` command returns an empty array '[]', the Data events are not included into the selected AWS Cloudtrail trail logging configuration, therefore the S3 object-level API operations performed within your AWS account are not recorded.\r\n6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for auditing each s3 bucket to identify other trails that are missing the capability to log Data events.\r\n7. Change the AWS region by updating the `--region` command parameter and perform the audit process for other regions.",
