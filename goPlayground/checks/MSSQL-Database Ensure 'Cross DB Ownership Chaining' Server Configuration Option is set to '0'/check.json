  "rationale": "When enabled, this option allows a member of the `db_owner` role in a database to gain access to objects owned by a login in any other database, causing an unnecessary information disclosure. When required, cross-database ownership chaining should only be enabled for the specific databases requiring it instead of at the instance level for all databases by using the `ALTER DATABASE`_`<database_name>`_`SET DB_CHAINING ON` command. This database option may not be changed on the `master`, `model`, or `tempdb` system databases.",
