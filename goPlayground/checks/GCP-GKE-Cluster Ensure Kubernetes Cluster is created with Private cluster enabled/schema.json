  "rationale": "With a Private cluster enabled, VPC network peering gives you several advantages over using external IP addresses or VPNs to connect networks, including:\nNetwork Latency: Public IP networking suffers higher latency than private networking.\nNetwork Security: Service owners do not need to have their services exposed to the public Internet and deal with its associated risks.\nNetwork Cost: GCP charges egress bandwidth pricing for networks using external IPs to communicate even if the traffic is within the same zone. If however, the networks are peered they can use internal IPs to communicate and save on those egress costs. Regular network pricing still applies to all traffic.",
