GCP-managed keys are used by Cloud Platform services such as App Engine and Compute Engine. These keys cannot be downloaded. Google will keep the keys and automatically rotate them on an approximately weekly basis. User-managed keys are created, downloadable, and managed by users. They expire 10 years from creation.\nFor user-managed keys, user have to take ownership of key management activities which includes:\nKey storage\nKey distribution\nKey revocation\nKey rotation\nProtecting the keys from unauthorized users\nKey recovery\nEven after owner's precaution, keys can be easily leaked by common development malpractices like checking keys into the source code or leaving them in Downloads directory, or accidentally leaving them on support blogs/channels.\nIt is recommended to prevent use of User-managed service account keys.",
