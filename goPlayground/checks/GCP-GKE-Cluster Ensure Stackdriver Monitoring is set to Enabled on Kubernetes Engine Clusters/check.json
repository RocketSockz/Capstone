For system metrics, Stackdriver creates a Deployment that periodically connects to each node and collects metrics about its Pods and containers, then sends the metrics to Stackdriver. Metrics for usage of system resources are collected from the CPU, Memory, Evictable memory, Non-evictable memory, and Disk sources.",
