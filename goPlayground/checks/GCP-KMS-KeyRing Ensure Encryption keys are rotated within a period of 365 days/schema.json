A key can also be created with a specified next rotation time. A key is a named object representing a cryptographic key used for a specific purpose. The key material, the actual bits used for encryption, can change over time as new key versions are created. A key is used to protect some corpus of data. You could encrypt a collection of files with the same key, and people with decrypt permissions on that key would be able to decrypt those files. Hence it's necessary to make sure rotation periodis set to specific time.",
