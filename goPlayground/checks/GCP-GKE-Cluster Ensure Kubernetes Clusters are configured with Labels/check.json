  "rationale": "Configured Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of objects. Labels can be attached to objects at creation time and subsequently added and modified at any time. Each object can have a set of key/value labels defined. Each Key must be unique for a given object. Labels enable users to map their own organizational structures onto system objects in a loosely coupled fashion, without requiring clients to store these mappings. Labels can also be used to apply specific security settings and 'auto configure' objects at creation.",
