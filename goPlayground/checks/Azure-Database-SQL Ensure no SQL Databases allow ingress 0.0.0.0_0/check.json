More granular IP addresses can be defined by referencing the range of addresses available from specific datacenters. By default, for a SQL server, a Firewall exists with StartIp of 0.0.0.0 and EndIP of 0.0.0.0 allowing access to all the Azure services. Additionally, a custom rule can be set up with StartIp of 0.0.0.0 and EndIP of 255.255.255.255 allowing access from ANY IP over the Internet. In order to reduce the potential attack surface for a SQL server, firewall rules should be defined with more granular IP addresses by referencing the range of addresses available from specific datacenters.",
