Egress and ingress traffic are controlled even if the traffic stays within the network (for example, instance-to-instance communication). For an instance to have outgoing Internet access, the network must have a valid Internet gateway route or custom route whose destination IP is specified. This route simply defines the path to the Internet, to avoid the most general (0.0.0.0/0) destination IP Range specified from Internet through RDP with default Port 3389. We need to restrict generic access from Internet to specific IP Range.",
