When Private Google Access is enabled, VM instances in a subnet can reach the Google Cloud and Developer APIs and services without needing an external IP address. Instead, VMs can use their internal IP addresses to access Google managed services. Instances with external IP addresses are not affected when you enable the ability to access Google services from internal IP addresses. These instances can still connect to Google APIs and managed services.",
