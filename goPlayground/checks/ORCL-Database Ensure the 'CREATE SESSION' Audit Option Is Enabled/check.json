  "rationale": "Auditing attempts to connect to the database is basic and mandated by most security initiatives. Any attempt to logon to a locked account, failed attempts to logon to default accounts or an unusually high number of failed logon attempts of any sort, for any user, in a particular time period may indicate an intrusion attempt. In forensics, the logon record may be first in a chain of evidence and contain information found in no other type of audit record for the session. Logon and logoff in the audit trail define the period and duration of the session.",
